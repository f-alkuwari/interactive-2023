<p> <ul> <br>To Be In A Time of War </ul></p>
<p> <ul> Etel Adnan</ul></p>

<p><ul>To say nothing, do nothing, mark time, to bend, to straighten up, <br>
to blame oneself, to stand, to go toward the window, <br>
to change one’s mind in the process, to return to one’s chair, to <br>
stand again, to go to the bathroom, to close the door, to then open <br>
the door, to go to the kitchen, to not eat nor drink, to return to <br>
the table, to be bored, to take a few steps on the <br>
rug, to come close to the chimney, to look at it, to find it dull, <br>
to turn left until the main door, to come back to the <br>
room, to hesitate, to go on, just a bit, a trifle, to stop, to <br>
pull the right side of the curtain, then the other side, to stare <br>
at the wall.</p></ul>

<p><ul>To look at the watch, the clock, the alarm clock, to listen to <br>
the ticking, to think about it to look again, to go to the tap, to <br>
open the refrigerator, to close it, to open the door, to feel the <br>
cold, to close the door, to feel hungry, to wait, to wait for - <br>
dinner time, to go to the kitchen, to reopen the fridge, to take <br>
out the cheese, to open the drawer, to take out a knife, to carry <br>
the cheese and enter the dining room, to rest the plate on the <br>
table, to lay the table for one, to sit down, to cut the cheese in <br>
four servings, to take a bite, to introduce the cheese in the ; <br> 
mouth, to chew and swallow, to forget to swallow, to day-dream, <br>
to chew again, to go back to the kitchen, to wipe one’s mouth, <br> 
to wash one’s hands , to dry them, to put the cheese back into the <br>
refrigerator, to close that door, to let go of the day. <br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To listen to the radio, to put it off, to walk a bit, to think, <br>
to give up thinking, to look for the key, to wonder, to do nothing, <br>
to regret the passing of time, to find a solution, to want to go to <br>
the beach, to tell that the sun is coming down, to hurry, to go down <br>
with the key, to open the car’s door, to sit, to pull in the door, <br>
put in the key, turn it on, heat the engine, to listen, to make <br>
sure nobody’s around, to pull back, to go ahead, to turn right, then <br>
left, to drive straight on, to follow the road, to take many <br>
curbs, to drive down the coast, look at the ocean, to admire it, <br>
to feel happy, to go up the hill, to reach the other side, then <br>
go straight, to stop, to make sure that the ocean has not disappeared, <br>
to feel lucky, to stop the engine, to open the door, to exit, to <br>
close the door, to look straight ahead, to appreciate the breeze, <br>
to advance into the waves. <br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To wake up, to stretch, to get out of bed, to dress, to stagger <br>
towards the window, to be ecstatic about the garden’s beauty, to observe <br>
the quality of the light, to distinguish the roses from the hyacinths, <br>
to wonder if it rained in the night, to establish contact with the <br>
mountain, to notice its color, to see if the clouds are moving, to stop, <br>
to go to the kitchen, to grind some coffee, to lit the gas, to heat <br>
water, hear it boiling, to make the coffee, to put off the gas, to <br>
pour the coffee, to decide to have some milk with it, to bring out the <br>
bottle, to pour the milk in the aluminum pan, to heat it, to be careful, <br>
to pour, to mix the coffee with the milk, to feel the heat, to bring the <br>
cup to one’s mouth, to drink, to drink again, to face the day’s chores, <br>
to stand and go to the kitchen, to come back and put the radio on, <br>
to bring the volume up, to hear that the war against Iraq has started. <br>
To get more and more impatient, to be hungry, to bite one’s <br>
nails, to wear a jacket, to open the door, wa1k down the hill, to <br>
look at the Bay, see boats, notice a big sailboat, to go on <br>
walking, to be breathless, to turn left, then right, to enter the <br>
Sushi-Ran, to wait, to look at the waitress, to call her, to rest <br>
one’s elbows on the table, to pull them back when the tea arrives, <br>
to order, to eat, to drink, to use chopsticks, to be through, to <br>
wipe one’s mouth with the napkin, to read the bill, to count, to <br>
pay, to thank graciously, to exit, to start the road uphill.<br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To rise early, to hurry down to the driveway, to look for the paper, <br>
take it out from its yellow bag, to read on the front-page WAR, <br>
to notice that WAR takes half a page, to feel a shiver down the spine, <br>
to tell that that’s it, to know that they dared, that they jumped <br>
the line, to read that Baghdad is being bombed, to envision a rain <br>
of fire, to hear the noise, to be heart-broken, to stare at the <br>
trees, to go up slowly while reading, to come back to the front-page, <br>
read WAR again, to look at the word as if it were a spider, to <br>
feel paralyzed, to look for help within oneself, to know helplessness, <br>
to pick up the phone, to give up, to get dressed, to look through <br>
the windows, to suffer from the day’s beauty, to hate to death the <br>
authors of such crimes, to realize that it’s useless to think, to <br>
pick up the purse, to go down the stairs, to see people smashed <br>
to a pulp, to say yes indeed the day is beautiful, not to know anything, <br>
to go on walking, to take notice of people’s indifference towards
each other. <br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To have lunch. To ask for some beer. To give one’s order. To drink,<br>
eat, and pay. To leave. To reach home. To find the key. To enter. <br>
To wait. To think about the war. To glance at the watch. To put on the <br>
news. To listen to the poison distilled by the military correspondents. <br>
To get a headache. To eat dry biscuits. To put the radio back on. To <br>
hear bombs falling on Baghdad. To listen to ambulances. To go out on <br>
the deck. To look at the lengthening shadows on the grass. To count a <br>
few dead flies on the pane. To go to the table and look at the mail. <br>
To feel discouraged. To drink some water. To not understand the wind. <br>
To wonder if the human race is not in chaos. To wish to blow <br>
up the planet. To admire those who are marching against the war.<br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To hear a war from far-away. For others; to bomb, eliminate a <br>
country, blow-up a civilization, destroy the living. To exit <br>
from one idea to enter another .To go. To cross the Golden Gate . To <br> 
enter San Francisco. To stop at the light. To enjoy the luminosity of <br>
the green. To be on Market Street. To see too many policemen. <br>
To be told to keep going. To see young men being arrested at the end <br>
of the march. To measure tension in the air. To seek Valencia. To go <br>
all the way to Connecticut St. and park the car. To enter through the <br>
gate of CCAC. To sit in a room which is dark. To listen to a poet, <br>
then to another, speak about a time gone. <br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To stop at the gas-station and fill up the tank. To go uphill, peek <br>
at Mount Tamalpais. To take a rest, breathe, contemplate. To find a <br>
path and walk on wet grounds. To enjoy the enormous variety of the shades <br>
of green on the mountain. To raise one’s eyes to the sky and bring <br>
them back on the horizon to compare the different greys of the <br>
sky. To try to speak to the clouds. To say yes, it’s impossible. To <br>
linger on the mystery of communication, to bemoan its absence. To say <br>
it’s okay, then not to believe oneself. To think of the morning news, <br>
to be horrified. To despise. To hate. To empty one’s head of overflowing <br> 
emotions. To regret that evil exists. To blame oneself for the existence <br>
of evil. To want to forget about it and not be capable of so doing. <br>
To wrap oneself with death. <br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To turn the page without moving into a new life. To put on the radio. <br>
To listen and receive much poison on one’s face. To curse the hour, the <br>
fire, the deluge and hell. To lose patience. To lynch misfortune. <br>
To prevent the trajectory of inner defeat from reaching the centre. <br>
To resist. To stand up. To raise the volume. To learn that <br>
the marches against the war are growing in number. To admit that human <br>
nature is multifaceted. To know that war is everywhere.<br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To admit that some do win. To drink some water. To turn in circles. <br>
To pretend that one is not spent out. To believe it. To pretend. To <br>
discuss with one’s heart. To talk to it. To quiet it down, if possible. <br>
To curse the savagery of the technologically powered new crusades. <br>
To remain in doubt. To come out of it in triumph. <br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To run down for the Sunday paper. To read: “Target: Baghdad.” <br>
Back to the radio, hear about the American dissidents. Hear that <br>
the Blacks are overwhelmingly against the war, that the Iraqis <br>
are resisting. Do some cleaning. To put up with an inner rage. <br>
To admit the evidence of evil, the existence of pain. To not be <br>
capable of finding, within, one’s source of energy. Feel gratitude <br>
for those who protest although knowing that they are moved by <br>
their own moral sense . Take risks, that’s what they do. To <br>
think that the Arab states feel uncertain, to say the least. <br>
To find the radio unbearable. <br></ul></p>

<p><ul>To wait for the reaction, the vengeance. To be thirsty, hot, then <br>
to feel cold. To invade the body, says evil. To speak of <br>
evil. To make a phone call. Not to tell all that one thinks. Not <br>
to think about all one knows. To hang up. To pick up the bottle of <br>
Correctol and start erasing memories. Not to be hungry but to eat, <br>
nevertheless. To satisfy other needs by eating. To feel disgusted. <br>
To count the dead of either side. To come back to the radio while <br>
congratulating oneself of not possessing a T.V. set. To listen <br>
to the Egyptian, Turkish, Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi reporters <br>
on the radio. To feel worn out.<br></ul></p>
