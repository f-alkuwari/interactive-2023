<p> <ul> <br>Earth as a body </ul></p>
<p> <ul> John Perreault</ul></p>

<p> <ul>Ana Mendieta's oeuvre is not difficult to situate
within the categories of advanced North American
art of the past two decades. We can only
guess how her work might have developed, but with her
tragic death in 1985 at the age of thirty-six, her body of
work became an oeuvre, a closed set. This set falls
within the overlapping categories of earth art, body art,
photo art, and perhaps performance art, with the work
of more recent years retaining characteristics from her earlier
developments within these genres but taking the
form of portable, relatively durable objects.</p> </ul>

<p> <ul>Although Mendieta was not strictly a pioneer in any
of the forms she began to synthesize quite brilliantly in
the early seventies, she was able to reinvent herself as an
artist, leaving her efforts at painting far behind. In the
process she created poetically and politically charged artworks
influenced by the antigallery, antiobject genres
that were spreading rapidly through the art world. News

<p><ul>Art, and performance art by many artists (and writers)
came in shock waves that signaled a release from
formalism-though many of these works were quite
formal-and from traditional ways of art making. The
then-emerging feminist movement in art must have
played a part too, for Mendieta's art works embody feminist
themes; she did at least one tableau/performance on
the subject of rape. The female body and the goddess symbolizing
creation and nature--were to become consistent
themes.</ul></p>

<p><ul>Consistency is certainly a factor in her success. No matter what the
medium or format, there is an intensity of vision that is
astounding. Mendieta did not dabble. Many artists have
learned to imitate themselves in order to satisfy requirements
of the art market. Mendieta was consistent because
she had no choice; she made the art she had to
make, which was the only art she could make and the
only art she needed to make. Her single-mindedness was
dictated by inner necessity. The act of tracing the outline
of her own body-her silhouette, her shadow upon
the earth in the long-lived "Silueta'' series was important
to her as art, as magic, as political act. This was
equally true of the rock carvings and inscriptions of female
symbols. These helped her heal herself, if only temporarily.
If one could claim even a small portion of the
earth as one's own territory, exile was assuaged.</ul></p>

<p><ul>As an adolescent, Mendieta was sent by her parents
from Castro's Cuba to the United States, where she lived
in orphanages and then in foster homes. Paradoxically,
her exile from Cuba eventually brought her closer to nature
and to Cuba. As an adult, she was decidedly not
anti-Castro, and in 1980 she returned for a visit, executing
the following year a series of hillside stone carvings.
However, after her fellowship at the American Academy
in Rome expired in 1984, she elected to stay in Italy Perhaps
she had become addicted to exile? On the other
hand, she felt closer to her Latin roots in Rome than in
New York. She was well on her way to proving that a woman
artist, an artist with Third World roots, and a so-called
minority artist could establish herself as an innovator.
Her artwork taps primitive imagery and sources of energy without being
exploitive. Mendieta did not appropriate; she found
her own images of power and meaning.</ul></p>

<p><ul>Forms, formats, genres, materials, are not at the center
of Mendieta's art. Her creative principles were elsewhere,
deeper and more personal. Her version of body
art aspired to the universal; she used the measurements
of her five-foot form to measure the world. She became
her own method of composition, imposing her outline
with ignited gunpowder, stones, flowers, fireworks, and
even a branding-iron cast of her hand upon selected outof-
the-way fragments of the natural environment; she
had herself bound in strips of cloth, buried in mud and
rocks; she traced her shadow in blood. She became a
priestess, an earth goddess. In terms of performance art,
she eschewed audience and thereby undercut what was
to become the dissipation of the genre into nightclub entertainment
and various forms of bad acting.</ul></p>

<p><ul>Like many emerging artists, Mendieta worked within
already existing formats-in her case, the most avantgarde
formats available--but unlike most, she used them
for her own ends, made them her own. It was a nearly
perfect match. She needed these forms; these forms inspired
her. Could her vision of the energies of nature
have been communicated through paintings and standard
forms of sculpture? I think not.</ul></p>

<p><ul>Mendieta's work of the eighties presents slightly different
sets of stylistic vectors, different formal problems.
The Cuban rock carvings are another aspect of the female
creative principle she saw at work in nature: the
earth as womb. The floor pieces and tree-trunk carvings
that were to follow take this same primitivistic imagery-
influenced by pictographs and prehistoric art into
the realm of the portable icon. She was manifesting
the general drift back to object making. One does not
know how conscious she was of what might be considered
a general capitulation to market values. She was not
alone. She could not survive on lectures and on a few
sales of color prints made from slides of her work or on
her beautiful drawings on leaves and bark paper. She
moved from earth to wood, from the horizontal to the
vertical, yet maintained her vision.</ul></p>

<p><ul>What was that vision? She pointed to it in various statements,
but it is the work itself that expresses it most profoundly.
She was a magician. Although we know for a
fact that she was interested in Santería--a New World,
Catholicized version of the African Yoruba religion her
interest went deeper than a fascination with spells,
spirit possessions, potions, and "saints:" Santería's cosmic
view is predicated upon a belief in powerful spirits
at work on earth. Mendieta saw the earth as a living
body, and she wanted to be one with that body. Nevertheless,
the tragic sense of exile that informs her artwork
suggests the separateness from nature and spirit that is almost
the definition of modern life. Mendieta's art tries to
overcome this separation, and it is this, not some formal
strategy, that accounts for the power of her body of
work, for we are all in exile.</ul></p>

<p><ul>Mendieta grew up a stranger in a strange land. A trip
to Mexico when she was at the University of Iowa
helped her gain some understanding of her Latin
American heritage, as did later meetings with other
Latin American artists. Feminism gave her additional support,
but her feminism was tempered by her understanding
that most feminists in the United States were white
and middle class and had little understanding of Third
World women.</ul></p>

<p><ul>Mendieta did not dwell morbidly upon her disrupted
youth; it was just part of her story. She had spunk. She
was fully aware of Latin American art and the work of
Latin American artists in the United States; she was
supportive and sympathetic. On the other hand, she was
determined to overcome ethnic cliches: art by Latin
American artists, in their native countries or in the
United States, need not be retardataire, and Mendieta's
work proves this. When we have finished the task of sorting
the art that emerged from seventies pluralism-a
task we are only now beginning-Mendieta's art will be
seen as far more important than it is now possible to
imagine. Her work foreshadows what can only be called
a turn to the spiritual.</ul></p>

<p><ul>Art is a belief system, and Mendieta believed in the
power of art to change lives. Art changed her life and allowed
her moments of equilibrium, caught between the
pain of exile and the transcendence of ritual. This is dangerous
territory, but all else is banal. Mendieta can either be seen as a romantic or as someone absolutely clearheaded
about how to heal the breach between humanity
and the nonhuman world. Mendieta's works are
about the numinous. At their finest, they are numinous
themselves.</ul></p>

<p><ul>What do we see when we look at what remains of her
art works? A few photographs depicting silhouettes on
the ground or rock carvings in Cuba. Later we see female
figures made of fernwood or constructed of vines.
We see earthly symbols on the floor. We see wood inscribed
with fire, as if this were the only way to let the
soul become visible. If we do not see beyond what we
see, then we are not seeing the art: we are stuck in the
fallen world of art products. Eschewing the sentimental
and, for the most part, the sensational, Mendieta was
courting the gods.</ul></p>
