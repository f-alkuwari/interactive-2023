  <h2><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedouin Techno: Party Music from the Arab World </h2>

<p><ul>Originally Published in <a href="https://electriccastle.com/ec-mag/122/omar-souleyman-party-music-from-the-arab-world"> Electric Castle</a> 2020, 2022 </ul> </p>
  <p> <ul> People who listen to obscure music from the Arab world have known Omar Souleyman for a long time. The Syrian born singer, currently living <br> in Turkey for obvious reasons, became popular in the Western world following the release of three albums by the American label Sublime Frequencies <br>
   a record company specializing in music from the most exotic places in the world. In 2017, he signed with Mad Decent, Diplo's label. This might a <br>weird combo considering Omar Souleyman is not a DJ and is not into EDM.</p> </ul>

  <p> <ul> Instead, he sings in Arabic on top of divine electronic harmonics. He doesn't speak a single word of English, but this hasn't stopped him from <br> performing live all over Europe and the United States. Basically, he has taught the entire Western world what the deal is with Arabic party music. <br> And how to dance with your shoulders. Yes, he promoted a dance named 'dabke', which matches perfectly with his music. Look it up on the web <br> and you'll see what I'm talking about. You still have a couple of months to learn to master it, before making shoulder moves in the fields of Bontida.<br> Here are a couple of other interesting facts about Omar Souleyman:</p></ul>

  <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was a farmer before he became a singer</h3>
 
<p> <ul>Omar Souleyman is not your typical singer born with the mic in his hand. He took up singing rather late, at around the age of 30. Before changing <br> careers, he was a humble farmer. Then he started singing at weddings. He was some sort of a fiddler. Unfortunately, everything changed when the <br> civil war broke out and he had to flee the country. </p></ul>

<h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He's very prolific, he released hundreds of albums</h3>

<p><ul>Even though he began his singing career at the age of 30, Omar Souleyman made up for the time spent on the fields, away from the stage. Over 600 <br> albums with his live shows have been released. Many of his wedding gigs have been audio-taped and sold in markets. The only issue is that many albums <br> have been lost. Again, because of the Syrian civil war. Anyway, Omar Souleyman is one of the most prolific singers in Syrian history. His manager <br> declared for Crack Magazine that Omar doesn't understand the meaning of the word 'break'.</p> </ul>

<h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He collaborated with Bjork and Four Tet</h3>

<p><ul>In 2011, when his music started to emerge at hipster parties in Europe, Omar Souleyman remixed Bjork's song Crystalline. It sounds very differently <br> from the original version on Biophilia. Who would have thought that a former Syrian farmer would end up collaborating with the most celebrated <br>Icelandic artist? Omar has also collaborated with Four Tet, who produced several of his tracks on Wenu Wenu and Bahdeni Nami.</p></ul>

<h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He performed at the 2013 Nobel Prize Ceremony</h3>

<p><ul>Omar Souleyman comes from a war-stricken region. Nonetheless, his music is super happy. All his songs sound like a party. Including the song he <br>performed in the concert organized during the 2013 Peace Nobel Prize awarding ceremony. His music is entirely positive. You don't understand the<br> language, but you feel the vibe rooted from his Bedouin identity. Even the luxury fashion house "Balenciaga" hired Omar to perform at a after party <br>for their latest collection on the sidelines of Paris Fashion Week 2022. </p></ul>
