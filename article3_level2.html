  <h2> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Transforming space:</i> The Production of Contemporary Syrian Music </h2>

  <p><ul>Burkhalter, Thomas</ul>

  <p> <ul> Critical approaches to the study of space as a practice, discourse, and cultural imaginary (Lefebvre 1991) have argued that representational <br> spaces are 'transformed through and on the basis of relations of power' (Rabinow 2003, 354). This claim raises the question of whether and <br> how this art world is imbricated in larger spatial formations that are embedded in local, regional, national, and global relations of power. <br> In what ways does the early twenty-first-century emergence of <i>musiqa mu'asira</i> articulate transformations of power, and how can these shifts <br> be grounded by broader historical understandings?</p> </ul>

<p> <ul> Syria became an independent nation-state in 1947, following centuries of Ottoman rule and French colonial occupation. Since then, artists <br> and intellectuals have debated the effects of imperialism and colonialism in the modern arts. Does contemporary music in Syria depend on <br> external discourses or privilege Western concepts of art music? The Syrian poet Adonis claims that cultural expression in the Arab world has <br> been constrained by the question of 'how to engage European culture successfully while presenting a link to the Arab past.' This 'double <br> dependency' on European forms of knowledge-at once aesthetic, historical, and political-reproduces European cultural hegemony and positions <br> Syrian music as a signifier of non-Western difference within the modern world. Others question whether these cultural politics engender a <br> crisis of representation, or 'representational paralysis,' in which cultural production stagnates in the absence or suppression of creative expression.</p> </ul>

<p> <ul> Rather than perpetuate the teleologies embedded in these critical discourses on cultural modernity, art historian Gao Minglu (2008) stresses <br> the emergent quality of cultural production. He suggests that conditions of production are embedded in 'a network of forever changing relations <br> among human subjectivity, living space, and experience' (Minglu 2008, 137). Contemporaneity is therefore situated within the flow of everyday <br> life as the 'permanent' condition of modernity.42 This reformulation brings together 'the jostling contingency of various cultural and social <br> multiplicities, all thrown together in ways that embrace the contradictions and inequalities within and between the particularities of shifting <br> lifeworlds' (Smith 2008, 8-9). Recapitulating to Syrian experiences of modernity, this perspective suggests that the social contradictions and <br>historical contingencies of <i>musiqa mu'asira</i> are what shape its various meanings in contemporary contexts. </p> </ul>

<p> <ul>The composers and works described in this essay are, in many ways, constrained by the predicament of Syrian modernity. They struggle to <br> define visions of cultural modernity and build audiences who are open to these visions. This position has been exacerbated by Syria's isolation <br> from the global flow of ideas, resources, and populations ever since the Ba'ath Party assumed power in 1963. Despite the Ba'athist state's claims <br> toward social progress and economic development, it has willingly faltered in integrating these agendas into the global political and economic <br> order. The authoritarian regime has legitimated this policy by invoking Third Worldist sentiments of anti-imperialism and anticolonialism that <br> support central Ba'athist tenets of Arab nationalism and socialism (Wieland 2006). Moreover, the state has actively suppressed alternative visions <br>political, cultural, or otherwise-through systems of coercion that perpetuate a culture of fear between and among citizens. </p> </ul>

<p> <ul><i>Musiqa mu'asira</i> is therefore situated in complex economic and political conditions that beg the following questions: What makes this musical <br> world contemporary? What historical processes have shaped the encounters and opportunities pursued by these composers? Does their creative <br> work offer a new vision for cultural modernity in Syria today? Prior to the onset of social unrest in Syria in 2011 linked to the broader 'Arab <br> Spring,' it seemed possible to attribute the blossoming of musical culture, ideas, and creativity in the past decade to policies of economic <br>liberalization and cultural development mandated by President Assad. As described earlier in this essay, patronage of the arts increased through <br> the building of new cultural centers and performance venues, state sponsorship of international contemporary arts festivals, allocation of resources <br> to programs and events, and funds for individual artists. It is not insignificant that the musical works and professional livelihoods discussed here <br> were made possible by state support for the arts.</p> </ul>

<p> <ul>It is problematic, however, to situate <i>musiqa mu'asira</i> as an outcome of economic development and social progress. The developmentalist logic <br> of the Ba'athist state is perpetuated by the assumption that <i>musiqa mu'asira</i> marks an unprecedented flourishing of avant-gardism and postmodernism <br> in the musical arts as well as the attribution of this development to economic liberalization in the last decade. These hegemonic forces conceal economic <br> and social disparities that have increased due to flawed policies of industrialization and modernization since the 1970s. Whereas economic liberalization <br> policies in the past decade assured citizens of increased access, benefits, and provisions, in reality, these have been distributed unevenly. Liberalization <br> has failed to reduce unemployment, curtail rising costs of living, or stabilize domestic security (Abboud 2009). In short, a 'social market economy' <br> selectively infused by privatization measures has not reformed society but rather reproduced the systematic contradictions and social grievances that <br> triggered the Syrian uprising in 2011. </p> </ul>

<p> <ul>The predicament of <i>musiqa mu'asira</i> is that it is at once contingent on liberalization and yet marginalized by its engagement with global soundworlds. <br> This field indicates the increased importation of conceptual and material resources; however, its emergence does not herald the diffusion of such cultural <br> capital into the musical lives of many Syrians. Perhaps due to decades of relative isolation from the global order, connoisseurs reject efforts to engage <br> with spectralism and atonalism and privilege <i>musiqa sharqiyya</i> as the most distinguished modern Arab musical expression. These aesthetic distinctions <br> occur in the context of a Ba'athist regime that legitimizes its authoritarian power through anti-Western and anti-imperialist rhetoric, which, in turn, service <br> its ideological commitment to pan-Arabism.</p> </ul>

<p> <ul>At the time of this writing in late summer 2011, contacts based in Damascus suggest that civil unrest and popular protests in Syria have not disrupted <br> musical life at Dar al-Assad. Though some students are not able to travel to Damascus from other regions due to anxieties over violence, the arts complex <br> has maintained its active calendar of programs and events, which are attended by full-capacity audiences. This situation is gradually shifting, however, as <br> international economic sanctions make a negative impact on the arts. It is possible to conjecture that the arts are relatively immune because urban elite have <br> been least affected by civil unrest, for reasons that may be historically traced to Hafez al-Assad's economic policies of infitah (opening) in the 1980s that <br> benefited urban mercantile elite (Perthes 1995). Each of the composers discussed in this essay has been based in Europe since before the Arab Spring in <br>order to pursue professional opportunities, and all plan to remain abroad for the foreseeable future. Like many Syrians residing abroad, they are uncertain <br> about what paths their brethren will pursue and how this may affect the conditions in which they produce artistic work.</p> </ul>

<p> <ul>Rather than assume that experimental composition developed in teleological alignment with discourses of progress and modernity, this essay embeds <i>musiqa <br> mu'asira</i> in the jostling conditions of history from which it emerged. The works discussed here represent the crossings, exchanges, and mediations that <br> composers experienced as they traversed musical routes and encountered disparate narratives of the global avant-garde. Uneven, paradoxical, and textured by <br> overlapping discourses of modernity, contemporary Syrian art music is itself an expression of the contemporaneity of musical worlds. </p> </ul>
